Use folder names as the person's name.

Store a few face images per person (JPG/PNG/etc.). Example:

training/inky/0.jpg
training/inky/1.jpg

Tip (Colab): Mount Google Drive and point TRAINING_DIR to your Drive folder, e.g.:

- TRAINING_DIR=/content/drive/MyDrive/infineon-project/training
- OUTPUT_DIR=/content/drive/MyDrive/infineon-project/training-outputs

Then run the training cell in train.ipynb.
